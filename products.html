	<p><strong>From the Manufacturer:</strong> “This game is based on Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway known for its distinctive metropolitan structure. The game has no board, no squares. Players build roadways across each others highway and compete to place all their cars under a certain rule. As you follow the simple steps and build your way, there arises a unique architectural space on the table. Build your original highway with the balance of your fingertips and creative construction strategy.”
	</p>
	<img src="images/pre-order3_tokyoh.jpg" alt="photo of 'Tokyo Highway' gameplay" class="main_center"> <br/>
	<p><strong>Our Take:</strong> Highly Creative, it invokes memories of construction-based games of the 1970’s and early 80s. Finding creative solutions to avoid traffic blocks, create towering lanes that carefully balance their loads and watch out for road blocks. B & E Stamp of approval!</p></div>
